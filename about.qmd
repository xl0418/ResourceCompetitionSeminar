This seminar is organised by [**Christopher Klausmeier**](https://www.kbs.msu.edu/kbs-people/faculty/christopher-klausmeier/) as the form of an online seminar on resource competition theory and related ecological theories from January 8th to April 15th 2024. The format is a mix of lectures and discussion of classic and recent papers. Some previous exposure to ecological theories and an intro grad level (e.g. population growth models & competition theory) is desired.

This blog is developed and maintained by [**Liang Xu**](https://github.com/xl0418), severing as an online lecture and providing an alternative to the programming illustration by Mathematica for those who cannot access Mathematica. The blog is developed using [**Quarto**](https://quarto.org/) and hosted on [**GitHub**](https://github.com/xl0418/Resource-Competition-2024). The interactive visulation of the model is implemented using [**R Shiny**](https://shiny.rstudio.com/). If you have any questions or suggestions, or would like to help, make corrections, please feel free to contact me via [**Email**](mailto:%20xl0418@gmail.com)
